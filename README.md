- The page should be aesthetically pleasing (aka be styled)/ Kind of sorta
For now do not worry that your page resets during a refresh, making that work is a stretch goal.
- Add some instructions to your README.md file around what your application is, how to run it, and how to use it.

- Make the list persist through a refresh of the page by using local storage to store to-do's
- Archive completed tasks in a viewable location on screen
