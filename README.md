TODO List

Requirements
In this application you will create a to-do list application that can do the following:
- Users should be able to view all of the to-do tasks
- Users should be able to add a to-do to the list of to-do tasks
- Users should be able to mark a task as completed by crossing it out on click
- Users should be able to remove to-do tasks by removing those elements from the DOM
- The page should be aesthetically pleasing (aka be styled)
For now do not worry that your page resets during a refresh, making that work is a stretch goal.

USER MANUAL :
1. Type in the "Add tasker field" what you'd like to add!
2. Click the add key, notice how the finger becomes a pointer. You're doing so good.
3. Watch as the tasker populates below, behold its majesty!
4. To strike through, click the tasker itself. It will grey out because it is sad you finished it and line through with red.
5. To close a tasker, click the close button. Watch as you remove the task from this webpage and existence. How could you...
